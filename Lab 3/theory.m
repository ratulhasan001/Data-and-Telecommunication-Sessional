A signal element is the shortest unit (timewise) of a digital signal.
The date rate defines the number of data elements (bits) sent in 1s.

line coding -->
Unipolar - NRZ
Polar - NRZ, RZ, and biphase (Manchester, and differential Manchester)
Bipolar - AMI and pseudoternary
Mutlilevel - 2B/1Q, 8B/6T, and 4D-PAM5
Multitransition - MLT-3

NRZ
Positive voltage defines bit 1
Zero voltage defines bit 0
